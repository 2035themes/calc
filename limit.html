<p>Glossary on the topic</p>

<p>A numbered series of numbers a1, a2,..., ap,... is called a numerical sequence.</p>

<p>A numerical sequence is called an ascending sequence if each of its members is larger than the previous one, in other words, if there is a true inequality for any of them (similarly, a descending numerical sequence is defined).</p>

<p>A sequence is called monotonous if it is either increasing or decreasing.</p>

<p>A sequence a1, a2, ..., ... is called limited if a common boundary can be specified for its members, i.e. if there is such a number C that the inequality is performed for all numbers n.</p>

<p>The sequence is bounded at the bottom, if there is a number m such that inequality is executed for any n . The number m is called the lower boundary of the sequence.</p>

<p>The number b is called the limit of the sequence if any pre-selected neighborhood of point b contains all the members of the sequence starting with some number.</p>

<p>When calculating the limits, the expressions with undefined values often appear. Such expressions are called uncertainties.</p>

<p>Theoretical material for independent study</p>

<p>Let each natural number be matched with a real number: number 1 corresponds to number a, number 2 corresponds to number a2, ..., number n corresponds to number a, etc. Then they say that a numeric sequence is given, and they write a1, a2, ..., ap or (ap), where a1, a2, ..., ..., a - members of the sequence.</p>

<p>A measured series of numbers a1, a2, ..., ap, ... is called a numeric sequence.</p>

<p>Methods of assigning sequences.</p>

<p>The simplest way to set a sequence is to set it using the formula of the common term, i.e., the formula that explicitly expresses the dependence of the n-th term of the sequence on n.</p>

<p>For example, the formula ап=2n specifies a sequence of even numbers 2,4,6,8,... .</p>

<p>Another important way to specify a sequence is the recurrence method, in which an expression linking the n-th term of the sequence to one or more previous ones is specified.</p>

<p>The word recurrence comes from the Latin word recurrens, which means "return". When we calculate a new, new sequence member, we sort of go back and use the already calculated previous members.</p>

<p>For example, the recurrence ratio an=an-1+2 together with equation a1=1 defines an arithmetic progression with the first term 1 and a difference of 2:1, 3, 5, 7, ... . This is nothing more than a sequence of odd numbers.</p>

<p>The sequence can also be given by a verbal description, which defines the process of building the sequence members.</p>
